Note, these files sorta confused me at first.
It appears that one size doesn't fit all and you'll likely need to edit one or more to make your needs.

I've added a file called pxc-aio.yaml which is the file that worked the best for me.
It'll get the server off the ground and may sync a cluster but timing is critical.
I'm not yet versed enough with Rancher/Kubernetes to correct this.

This file works with the ../rancher-catalog/ files. Where you see ${ABC123} this is injected into Rancher GUI.
